## API keys tab

Configure one service at a time:

1. Select service from dropdown
2. Set **URL** (must be reachable from container)
3. Paste **API key** (blank field = keep existing saved key)
4. **Test connection** — uses form values without saving
5. **Save** (toolbar) persists all pending changes

Secrets are stored in `service-secrets.json` and override environment variables for keys.

---

## Live preview behaviour

- Layout/appearance/list changes call `ScheduleLivePreviewNow` or debounced preview
- Unsaved state shows **Preview dashboard** chip in toolbar
- **Discard** reloads from disk and clears preview
- Preference changes trigger a dashboard refresh so lists match new filters

---

## Last refresh display

The hero **Last refresh** label uses finer granularity than item timestamps (`42s ago` vs `just now`) and ticks every 10 seconds so auto-poll at 30s does not look stuck.

Item timestamps still follow **Time display** (Relative / Clock / Date+time).
