# ArrDash

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

**ArrDash** is a [Blazor Server](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) dashboard for homelab media stacks. It aggregates recent downloads from the *arr apps, audiobooks from Chaptarr and AudioBookShelf, music from Lidarr, and live playback from Plex and Emby — in one configurable UI.

cd arrdash-blazor
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
# Edit docker-compose.yml — set service URLs and API keys

## Stack

- **.NET 8** — Blazor Server (interactive)
- **MudBlazor 7** — UI components
- **SignalR** — live dashboard updates
- **Docker** — recommended deployment

## Service URLs

ArrDash calls each *arr / media app over HTTP from inside the container. Use URLs that resolve **from the container network** — typically HTTPS hostnames on your LAN or split-DNS FQDNs, not `localhost` on the host unless you know routing works.

See [services.md](docs/services.md) for per-app notes.

## Persistence

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `/config/user-layout.json` | Theme, layout, behaviour preferences |
| `/config/service-secrets.json` | API keys saved from the Settings UI |

Environment variables seed initial URLs and keys; the Settings UI can override and persist secrets without redeploying.

## Tests

```bash
dotnet test tests/ArrDash.Tests/ArrDash.Tests.csproj
```

135+ unit tests cover settings wiring, theme building, filters, and display helpers.
